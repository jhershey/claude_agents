| **Tester**               | Executes code or tests to validate behavior                                 | Generator or Refiner output                   | Pass/fail report with tracebacks or edge case confirmations                   |
| **Prompt Coach**         | Helps users learn to write better prompts themselves                        | Raw or ineffective user prompt                | Clarifying question + 1–2 tactical suggestions                                |
